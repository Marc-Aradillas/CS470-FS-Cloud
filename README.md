## üí° Experiences and Strengths

CS 470 has been pivotal in shaping my skills as a full stack developer with a strong understanding of cloud-native technologies. Through this course, I learned how to containerize applications using Docker and orchestrate them using Docker Compose. I deployed a monolithic MEAN stack application into a serverless environment and successfully integrated AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.

### Key Skills Acquired
- Creating and deploying RESTful APIs using AWS Lambda
- Configuring CORS, permissions, and IAM policies for secure cloud communication
- Using Docker to containerize apps and manage isolated environments
- Hosting static websites on AWS S3 and managing endpoints via API Gateway

### Strengths as a Developer
I‚Äôm confident in architecture patterns for scalability and maintainability, CI/CD integration, and cloud-based debugging. I‚Äôm prepared to pursue roles such as:
- Cloud Developer  
- Full Stack Engineer  
- Junior DevOps Engineer

## üöÄ Planning for Growth

Cloud-native architecture enables cost-effective and scalable solutions. Here's how I'd plan for growth:

### Microservices & Serverless Efficiencies
- Modularizing services (e.g., auth, Q&A, analytics) for independent scaling
- Serverless functions provide cost-effective execution and auto-scaling

### Scale & Error Handling
- Use throttling (API Gateway) and monitoring (CloudWatch)
- Retry logic and Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) for resilient Lambda operations

### Cost Considerations
- **Serverless**: Great for low/moderate use; pay-per-execution
- **Containers**: Better for constant high-load services; reserved instance pricing

### Pros & Cons
**Serverless**
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling, cost-effective, no server management  
- ‚ùå Cold starts, timeouts, vendor lock-in  

**Containers**
- ‚úÖ Customizable, good for long-running services  
- ‚ùå Requires orchestration, more maintenance  

### Elasticity & Pay-for-Service
Elasticity ensures demand-based scaling. Pay-for-service ensures cost control. Together, they provide a sustainable growth path for cloud apps.

## üéØ Conclusion

This project enhanced my real-world development and deployment skills on AWS. I leave this course confident in my ability to:
- Design scalable full stack applications
- Secure and monitor cloud-native solutions
- Articulate and present technical concepts effectively

This is now a cornerstone artifact in my developer portfolio.
