Experiences and Strengths
CS 470 has been pivotal in shaping my skills as a full stack developer with a strong understanding of cloud-native technologies. Through this course, I learned how to containerize applications using Docker and orchestrate them using Docker Compose. I deployed a monolithic MEAN stack application into a serverless environment and successfully integrated AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.
The most valuable technical skills I developed include:
•	Creating and deploying RESTful APIs using AWS Lambda
•	Configuring CORS, permissions, and IAM policies for secure cloud-based communication
•	Using Docker to containerize applications and manage isolated environments
•	Hosting static websites on AWS S3 and managing endpoints via API Gateway
My strengths as a developer now include the ability to identify architecture patterns suited for scalability and maintainability. I have grown more proficient in debugging cloud-based deployments and ensuring smooth CI/CD integrations. I am comfortable assuming roles such as Cloud Developer, Full Stack Engineer, or Junior DevOps Engineer, where AWS, Docker, and API development are core skills.

Planning for Growth
The transition to serverless architecture has shown me how essential scalability, cost-efficiency, and security are to modern web development. Planning for growth in this context involves leveraging elasticity and pay-for-service features that AWS offers.
Microservices and Serverless Advantages:
•	Breaking the app into microservices allows for independent deployment and scaling of services like authentication, question handling, and analytics.
•	Serverless functions allow dynamic scaling and cost savings since they only incur charges when in use.
Handling Scale and Errors:
•	I would implement throttling rules in API Gateway and use AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts.
•	Retry strategies and Lambda DLQs (Dead Letter Queues) would be added to capture failures without interrupting the user experience.
Cost Prediction:
•	Serverless (Lambda) offers more predictable costs for low-to-moderate workloads since it is charged per execution.
•	Containers may be more predictable for high-load or continuously running services due to reserved compute resource pricing in ECS or EC2.
Pros and Cons of Serverless vs. Containers:
•	Serverless Pros: Lower overhead, no server management, auto-scaling, event-driven design
•	Serverless Cons: Cold starts, timeout limits, vendor lock-in
•	Containers Pros: Custom runtime, portability, long-running services
•	Containers Cons: Higher overhead, manual scaling unless paired with orchestration tools
Elasticity and Pay-for-Service: These concepts are central to my future planning. Elasticity ensures the application can automatically scale with demand, while the pay-for-service model ensures we only incur costs for what we use. For startups or growing platforms, this model ensures a sustainable path toward expansion without overcommitting on infrastructure.

Conclusion
CS 470 equipped me with practical cloud deployment skills, honed my troubleshooting abilities, and expanded my confidence working in AWS. I now understand not only how to develop full stack applications but how to make them scalable and secure for real-world users. This project has given me a strong artifact for my portfolio and a robust foundation to build on as I enter the tech industry.
